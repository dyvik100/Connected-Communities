# Connected-Communities
Regarding the name: connected "communities" is apt because we're taking an initiative NOT ONLY to connect and form a network of spaces that support open source activities But also, to connect the communities that these spaces foster. Assuming,that these spaces might also be used by other open source communities or maybe otherwise for their own proceedings and meetings.
